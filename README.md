### Overview
Deja Brew is a website that provides visitors a list of breweries local to Denver, CO
that provides a list of beers, a map of the location, and allows registered users to
leave ratings and reviews for the establishment.

A user is also able to view a list of their reviews on their user page, and if they
notice that a review was particularly harsh or unfair click on the breweries name
go to that breweries page and delete their personal reviews. Besides leaving reviews
a user is able to create a new brewery that is not on the website yet.

Additionally users with admin privileges are capable of deleting users that are
incapable of playing nice with others.
